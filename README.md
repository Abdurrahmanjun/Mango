# Mango(In progress)

Mango is an Android App for [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). Inspired by [Resplash](https://github.com/b-lam/Resplash), [Plaid](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid) and  [Protein](https://github.com/gejiaheng/Protein).

**STILL UNDER DEVELOPING**.

## Features
+ Kotlin and RxKotlin: Yes, fully written in Kotlin.
+ MVP architecture: Whole project is built on MVP architecture.
+ Material Design: Trying my best. No bottom navigation barðŸ™ˆ.
+ Deep link: Yes. Using [DeepLinkDispatch](https://github.com/airbnb/DeepLinkDispatch) from [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb).
+ Dependency injection: Yes, using [dagger2](https://github.com/google/dagger).
+ Usage of awesome libraries: [Anko common](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko), [Flexbox layout](https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout), [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html).

## Build
### Open the project in Android Studio
```
git clone https://github.com/TonnyL/Mango.git
```

Open the `Mango/` directory in Android Studio.

### Troubleshooting
+ Update the Android Studio to latest version.
+ Update the Kotlin to lates version.
+ Try to clean the project and rebuild it.
+ If none of the solutions above, file an issue or email me.

### Dribbble OAuth
The App client id, client secret and client access token are placed in [ApiConstants.kt](./app/src/main/java/io/github/tonnyl/mango/retrofit/ApiConstants.kt) file. But due to the [Rate Limiting](http://developer.dribbble.com/v1/#rate-limiting) and the possibility that Mango App may be available in Google Play (Check the [blueprints](https://github.com/TonnyL/Mango/wiki/Blueprints) for more details), if you want to continue the development, I suggest you register your own App at [Dribbble Developer Center](https://dribbble.com/account/applications/new) and modify the constants with your owns.
